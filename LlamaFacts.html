        <h1>Amazing Llama Facts!</h1>
        <p>These fun facts about llamas will make you feel all fuzzy inside.</p>
        
        <p>
            <ul>
            <li>Llamas are members of the camelid family meaning they're pretty closely related to vicu√±as and camels.</li><br><br>
            
            <li>Camelids first appeared on the Central Plains of North America about 40 million years ago. About 3 million years ago, llamas' ancestors migrated to South America.</li><br><br>

            <li>During the last ice age (10,000-12,000 years ago) camelids went extinct in North America. Now there are around 160,000 llamas and 100,000 alpacas in the United States and Canada.</li><br><br>

            <li>Llamas were first domesticated and used as pack animals 4,000 to 5,000 years ago in the Peruvian highlands.</li><br><br>

            <li>Llamas can grow as much as 6 feet tall though the average llama between 5 feet 6 inches and 5 feet 9 inches tall.</li><br><br>

            <li>Llamas weigh between 280 and 450 pounds and can carry 25 to 30 percent of their body weight, so a 400-pound male llama can carry about 100 to 120 pounds on a trek of 10 to 12 miles with no problem.</li><br>
